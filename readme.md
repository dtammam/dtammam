# Hello, I'm Dean 👋

<!-- Add a profile picture if desired -->

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about many things, programming being one of the main things at the moment. This is where I save my personal code and learn from other much better programmers than myself 😁.
This GitHub profile and the repos contained within are all part of my 'Best I got right now' package. They are the reflections of the best I could do at the time and the bar will continue to be raised through time, until... actually, it'll just continue happening because excellence is a constantly shifting bar (once you achieve excellence it becomes the norm).

## About Me
- 🫠 Just a dude doing stuff and things
- 💿 Am currently a professional Endpoint Engineer, doing a lot of scripting in a hybrid Azure Windows enterprise environment
- 🌱 Currently learning JavaScript for programmatically interacting with the web and interfacing with AI systems
- 🚶🏻 Love exercising (primarily walking and Dance Dance Revolution)
- 🧑🏻‍🏭 You can find me on [LinkedIn]()

## My Interests
Here are a few things that I'm enthusiastic about:
- 📈 Personal Development: Love learning and improving, it's the most fun part of most things I find myself doing
- ⚙️ Systemization: Naturally try to systemize things, be it processes, notes or general tasks to do in life (the idea of putting code into functions makes my soul happy)
- 🧠 Artificial Intelligence: Have been following contemporary AI closely, love ChatGPT and the OpenAI API
- 🧑🏻‍💻 Technology at large: Get a lot of satisfaction and find it very fun to generally play with tech (servers, computers, phones, scripts, etc.)
- 👀 YouTube: Consume the majority of content there (classes, conversations, music, silly things)

## Projects
Here are a few modern repos that represent my programming:
- [ddr-picker ⬅️⬆️⬇️➡️](https://github.com/dtammam/ddr-picker): A Dance Dance Revolution front-end interface for selecting multiple games
- [Mothership on Main 🛸](https://github.com/dtammam/Mothership-on-Main): A browser extension that allows for an optimized custom homepage
- [PowerShell Learnings 📖](https://github.com/dtammam/PowerShell-Scripts): A repo of random and ongoing learnings with PowerShell, my current primary language

Thanks for reading 🙂
