Hi, I’m Dean 👋

I'm a guy who does stuff and things!
I like tech, music, rhythm games and hanging with my baby Daisy 👶🏽

I'll be using GitHub as a way to store early code and learn repo management.

dtammam/dtammam is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
