# Hello, I'm Dean ðŸ‘‹  
This is where I save personal code and learn many fun things.
This GitHub profile and the repos contained within are all part of my 'best I can do right now' package and are reflections of the best I could do at the time. Expect ongoing evolution and iterations to be made!
The bar will continue to be raised because excellence is constantly being redefined and there's way too much knowledge to obtain in a single human lifetime ðŸ˜µ

I love contemporary AI (generative AI to be specific) and blog about it on my [Substack](https://deantammam.substack.com/).
You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dean-tammam-15b4775a/).
